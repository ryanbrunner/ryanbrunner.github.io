              I'm a web developer, agile coach, and jack-of-all-trades from Toronto. I'm here to help
              your people, products and process scale.

        <h2>Agile Coaching and Training</h2>
        
        <p>
          Agile doesn't need to be complicated. I can help your
          team tailor an effective process for getting stuff done
          reliably, predictably, and at a high quality level. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Rather than forcing a "one-size fits all approach" like
          Scrum or Kanban, I'll work with your team to learn
          about the problems you're currently facing and how to 
          make small changes to make everyone work better together.

        <p>
          I've helped build web applications for businesses
          for the past 15 years. I specialize in Ruby on Rails, 
          Javascript, and general web design and development.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Whether you need a web presence for your small business,
          help with a project, or a fully-fledged web application, 
          I'm here to help.
